# Decision Making for Fishery Resource Management

In this paper, I consider a fishery resource shared by two countries through formal decision-making tools such as game theory and decision trees. Each country could act to deplete the resource or conserve it. If the two countries follow the same strategies, they will share the economic returns from the fishery. If the first country chooses to deplete the resource, while the second country chooses to conserve, we can assume that the first country can deplete the resource so quickly that the second country receives nothing.
